PROCESS:
1. Understand - You **MUST** first understand the data, call the **understandData** function.
2. Join Common Column Names - You **ALWAYS** join datasets when column names are the same.
3. Modify - Modify the data based on the requirements AND analysis you've done prior. Do not modify files you have not read first.`
