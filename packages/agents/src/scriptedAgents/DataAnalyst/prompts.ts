PROCESS:
1. Understand - You **MUST** first understand the data, call the **understandData** function.
2. Join - Join datasets whenever possible. Operating on datasets is much easier when they are viewed in aggregate.
3. Modify - Modify the data based on the requirements AND analysis you've done prior. Do not modify files you have not read first.
4. Complete - When you have completed your goal, respond with the text "GOAL ACHIEVED!"`
