  x fix multiple goals => multiple chats
x fix workspace not being updated
- improve usage of "<anon>"

NITs:
- improve loading of chatid routes

Test:
- handle abort mid-goal execution
x sending same goal twice (retyping)
x chats updating on backend & in app synchronously
  x start goal, switch, watch db, switch back, check app (may not be same)
