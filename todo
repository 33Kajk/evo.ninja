TODO:
- authenticated
  - fix first login bug, can't create chat
  - fix multiple goals => multiple chats
- fix workspace not being updated
- improve usage of "<anon>"

Bugs:
- send prompt -> meet quota -> add openai key -> stuck in loading

NITs:
- improve loading of chatid routes

Test:
- sending same goal twice (retyping)
- handle abort mid-goal execution
- chats updating on backend & in app synchronously
  - start goal, switch, watch db, switch back, check app (may not be same)
- 2 tabs, same chat open in both, send in one, watch other
  - chatGPT loads only on reload of app
